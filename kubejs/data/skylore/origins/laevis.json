	"description": "The 'Laevis' are a sub species of Technari. These are the sect of society of Technari that did not accept 'Mekanism' as a savior of their species. Therefore did not accept technology as a main means of living life. The Laevis set out into the universe to find a new home. Only to find Atmos instead. The Laevis upon coming to Atmos, centering around organics, discovered the glow berry and itâ€™s properties."
